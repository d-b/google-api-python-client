<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(project, backendService, body)</code>
  <pre>Update the entire content of the BackendService resource.

Args:
  project: string, Name of the project scoping this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A BackendService resource. This resource defines a group of backend VMs together with their serving capacity.
    "kind": "compute#backendService", # Type of the resource.
    "protocol": "A String",
    "description": "A String", # An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
    "timeoutSec": 42, # How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a failed request. Default is 30 seconds.
    "port": 42, # Deprecated in favor of port_name. The TCP port to connect on the backend. The default value is 80.
    "backends": [ # The list of backends that serve this BackendService.
      { # Message containing information of one individual backend.
        "group": "A String", # URL of a zonal Cloud Resource View resource. This resource view defines the list of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine instances from each resource view must live in the same zone as the resource view itself. No two backends in a backend service are allowed to use same Resource View resource.
        "description": "A String", # An optional textual description of the resource, which is provided by the client when the resource is created.
        "maxUtilization": 3.14, # Used when 'balancingMode' is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the CPU utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid range is [0, 1].
        "maxRatePerInstance": 3.14, # The max RPS that a single backed instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.
        "capacityScaler": 3.14, # The multiplier (a value between 0 and 1e6) of the max capacity (CPU or RPS, depending on 'balancingMode') the group should serve up to. 0 means the group is totally drained. Default value is 1. Valid range is [0, 1e6].
        "maxRate": 42, # The max RPS of the group. Can be used with either balancing mode, but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.
        "balancingMode": "A String", # The balancing mode of this backend, default is UTILIZATION.
      },
    ],
    "fingerprint": "A String", # Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a BackendService. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the BackendService.
    "portName": "A String", # Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the resource views referenced by this service. Required.
    "healthChecks": [ # The list of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck resource for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health check can be specified, and a health check is required.
      "A String",
    ],
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format (output only).
    "id": "A String", # Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only).

    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
